## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Initial setup
Run `docker compose up -d` <-- starts the Docker dev environment
Run `make initialize-pg` <-- creates the db and initial seed of data. Only run once!

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve api` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build api` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
npx nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
npx nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

## Custom Generators

- [Docs](https://nx.dev/extending-nx/recipes/local-generators)

This package utilizes a custom generator. To add a new generator run the following command from with the container:

`nx generate @nx/plugin:generator <new-generator-name> --project=plugins-nx`

To utilize a custom generator, add it to the Makefile, or type the following:

`nx generate @dx/plugins-nx:<custom-generator-name>`

Currently in Makefile is
  `make lib-module-dry`
  `make lib-module`

## Cloning this project

 1. Simply copy into new directory
 1. Find and replace all project name `dx`, in this case
 1. run `docker compse up` from root.
 1. type `make shell`
 1. run `nx reset` inside the container
 1. code away ðŸ˜œ

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)

## Explore the project graph

Run `npx nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.
